## Database Migration (January 27, 2025) 🔄

### MongoDB to PostgreSQL Migration

#### Rationale for Migration
We've decided to migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL for several critical reasons:

1. **Data Relationships**
   - The space rental application has clear relational data (Users, Rooms, Bookings)
   - PostgreSQL's foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
   - Complex joins needed for booking queries are more efficient in PostgreSQL

2. **Data Consistency**
   - ACID compliance crucial for booking transactions
   - Prevents double-bookings through transaction management
   - Schema enforcement ensures data consistency

3. **Query Capabilities**
   - Better support for complex booking queries (date ranges, availability)
   - Efficient joins between users, rooms, and bookings
   - Advanced indexing for performance optimization

4. **Type Safety**
   - PostgreSQL's strict schema complements TypeScript
   - Better integration with TypeORM for type-safe queries
   - Reduces runtime errors through schema validation

#### Migration Progress ✅

1. Database Setup:
   - ✅ PostgreSQL 15.9 installed locally
   - ✅ Created space_rental database
   - ✅ Created space_rental_user with appropriate permissions
   - ✅ Configured database connection string in .env

2. TypeORM Integration:
   - ✅ Installed TypeORM and PostgreSQL dependencies
   - ✅ Updated tsconfig.json for TypeORM decorators
   - ✅ Configured database.ts with TypeORM settings
   - ✅ Created entity models with TypeORM decorators:
     * User.ts: Added relations, timestamps, and column types
     * Room.ts: Added enum types for status and relations
     * Booking.ts: Added date/time columns and relations

3. Code Updates:
   - ✅ Updated Room controller to use TypeORM repository pattern
   - ✅ Updated authentication middleware for TypeORM
   - ✅ Removed MongoDB-specific code
   - ✅ Added proper error handling for database operations

#### Database Setup Issues and Solutions (January 27, 2025) 🛠️

During the initial database setup, we encountered and resolved several issues:

1. **User Creation Issue**
   - 🚨 Issue: Initial attempt to create database user failed silently
   - 🔍 Symptom: Node.js server crashed with "role space_rental_user does not exist"
   - ✅ Solution: 
     * Dropped existing database and user to start fresh
     * Used correct SQL syntax for user creation with single quotes
     * Created user and database in correct order with proper ownership
     * Added schema privileges explicitly

2. **Database Initialization**
   - ✅ Successfully created database components:
     * Created space_rental_user with password
     * Created space_rental database with proper ownership
     * Granted all necessary privileges on database and schema
     * Verified user and database creation with psql commands

3. **Schema Creation**
   - ✅ TypeORM automatically created:
     * Custom enum types:
       - rooms_status_enum (available, unavailable, maintenance)
       - bookings_status_enum (pending, rented, cancelled)
       - bookings_form_type_enum (internal, external)
       - users_role_enum (admin, user)
     * Tables with proper constraints:
       - users (with email uniqueness)
       - rooms (with status enum)
       - bookings (with foreign key relationships)

4. **Final Configuration**
   - ✅ Database URL in .env:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://space_rental_user:SpaceRental2024!@localhost:5432/space_rental
     ```
   - ✅ Successful connection from Node.js backend
   - ✅ Server running in development mode on port 5000

#### Frontend Development Issues (January 27, 2025) 🛠️

During the frontend development and testing, we encountered and addressed several issues:

1. **API Configuration Issues**
   - 🚨 Issue: Frontend unable to connect to backend API due to hostname mismatch
   - 🔍 Root Cause: Frontend using dynamic hostname (mge-laptop) while backend CORS configured for localhost
   - ✅ Solution: 
     * Updated API configuration to use consistent localhost URL
     * Removed unused hostname variable
     * Modified frontend to bind to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)

2. **Network Access**
   - 🚨 Issue: Unable to access frontend through localhost
   - 🔍 Status: In Progress
   - ⏳ Next Steps:
     * Test frontend accessibility through localhost:3000
     * Verify CORS configuration between frontend and backend
     * Test registration flow end-to-end

3. **Database Integration**
   - ✅ Database created and configured successfully
   - ✅ TypeORM entities and relationships established
   - ⏳ Need to test:
     * User registration flow
     * Data persistence
     * Error handling

#### Next Steps 🚧

1. **Frontend Development**
   - ⏳ Test and verify frontend accessibility
   - ⏳ Complete end-to-end testing of registration flow
   - ⏳ Implement proper error handling and user feedback

2. **Backend Integration**
   - ⏳ Verify CORS configuration
   - ⏳ Test API endpoints with frontend
   - ⏳ Implement proper error responses

3. Complete Controller Updates:
   - ⏳ Update authController.ts for TypeORM
   - ⏳ Add transaction support for booking operations
   - ⏳ Implement proper error handling

2. Testing:
   - ⏳ Test database connections
   - ⏳ Verify entity relationships
   - ⏳ Test CRUD operations
   - ⏳ Validate booking constraints

3. Data Migration:
   - ⏳ Create migration scripts
   - ⏳ Test data migration process
   - ⏳ Verify data integrity
